# VPC_lab  
#### This readme will document my learning process of virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS  

I will be following this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2JOHLHh4rI)  

<!-- ![alttext](/images/filename) -->

Using an existing subscription to acloudguru (ACG), I create a sandbox AWS environment.  
  
This free account allows me to follow the video closely and create the resources.

###  Exercise 1. Creating a VPC with subnets  



- Login to AWS console  
- Go to VPC dashboard  
- Create VPC  
- Refer to [custom-vpc.md](/Code/Amazon VPC/custom-vpc.md) to copy and paste the values into the forms  
- Created VPC, `Name: MyVPC IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16`

- Now to create Subnets, recall that subnets must have IPs within the original `IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16`
